        description: `My 3 sons have gone through swimming classes with Mehdi and turned into a fully fledged athletes mastering all the swimming techniques almost to a professional level. Mehdi is an extremely attentive coach and approaches each character individually. For example, my youngest one is a judoka and Mehdi‚Äôs swimming classes were structured in a way to strengthen his fitness, breathing and durability. My other son was aiming at the swimming results and had rigorous classes to attain the top timing. At present they are fully mastering all swimming techniques and styles, feeling absolutely confident and in command of the water. When back from boarding school and on holidays they often still ask to train with Mehdi. As a parent, I couldn‚Äôt recommend him more, whether it is just for health maintenance reasons or professional sports achievements.`
